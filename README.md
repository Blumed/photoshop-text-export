## Photoshop Text Export

This is a Photoshop Script that will allow you to export all of the text layers from your PSD along with their font styles.

Currently the script does not support multiple font styles on one text layer.

This is based on the 'PS_BRAMUS Text Export 1.3' script from [bram.us](http://www.bram.us/2008/03/16/ps_bramustextexport-13-automatically-export-all-text-layers-from-photoshop-psd-to-a-text-file/)
